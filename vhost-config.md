# Example Configuration for WordPress with Apache and Reverse Proxy

This configuration file provides an example of an Apache VirtualHost that runs a WordPress installation behind a reverse proxy. All domains, paths, and certificate paths are for example purposes only and should be replaced with your own values.

```apache
# WordPress
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName example.com
    ServerAlias www.example.com
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile "C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/SSL-Certs/main/example.com-crt.pem"
    SSLCertificateKeyFile "C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/SSL-Certs/main/example.com-key.pem"
    SSLCertificateChainFile "C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/SSL-Certs/main/example.com-chain.pem"
    # Change SSL Paths if needed
    
    ErrorLog "logs/example_ssl_error_log"
    CustomLog "logs/example_access_log" combined
    
    # Reverse Proxy
    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:11000/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:11000/
    # Change Ports if needed

</VirtualHost>
